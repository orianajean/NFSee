# NFSee: Parallel iOS & Android

This repo has two apps: **NFSee-Apple** (Swift/SwiftUI/SwiftData) and **NFSee-Android** (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose). They must stay in feature parity.

## Rule: One Change = Both Platforms

- **When adding or changing a data model on iOS** (SwiftData `@Model`, new fields, relationships): add or update the equivalent on Android (Room entities/DAOs or equivalent state).
- **When adding or changing a screen or flow on iOS**: add or update the same screen/flow on Android with equivalent behavior (same actions, same info shown).
- **When adding or changing logic on Android** (new entity, screen, or business rule): mirror the same data shape and behavior on iOS.

## Reference

- **Data model:** See `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` (Containers, Items, status: In / Out / Removed).
- **Full plan:** Same doc (phases, local-first, no Firebase for MVP).

## Before Marking a Feature Done

Confirm: *Can the user do the same core action on both iOS and Android?* If not, implement the missing side.
